KSS is looking for a candidate who is imaginative, artistic and well-versed with all technical functionalities of photoshop.  During the internship the candidate will produce a suite of web icons to replace usual 'select', 'hover', 'click' and other icons.  These icons will take after elements representing website theme - e.g. a mouse pointer may be designed as a honey ladle to replace the standard pointer icon on a honey website.  The other key task in the internship is to make web cards, blending various photos and abstracting various parts of a photo and reusing them in imaginative ways in order to suit the website themes.",

A single tree yields 40-100 coconuts and 300-400 liters of flower nectar annually. The nectar value is much higher than that of the fruit.  Dwarf varieties found in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Fiji can be harvested using a ladder.  In addition to harvesting coconuts, a tree climber must clean the crown of the dead leaves and insect nests, spray protective solutions, slice the tip of coconut flowers to tap the nectar and harness collection vessels.  These harvest life cycle tasks are mostly done manually, globally. Carrying out these tasks on tall trees whose nuts are most suitable for coconut oil production is risky.  Accidental falls can be fatal.  Occupational dermatosis on the ankle, palm and forearm regions are common amongst climbers.  Even without full automation, a robotic or a robot-assisted climbing or harvesting can raise efficiency and mitigate occupational hazard. Globally, c40 billion coconuts are harvested annually.  This translates into c2 billion climb operations.  Some solutions such a tree climber scooter with an integral human capsule and remotely piloted climbers are available. Click",
